<!-- 
User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

                        <p><strong>Plug brewer into its own grounded outlet.</strong> If the electric circuit is overloaded with other
                        appliances, your brewer may not function
                        properly. The brewer should be operated on
                        its own circuit, separate from other appliances.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Keep your brewer turned “ON.”</strong> To brew a fresh cup of coffee, tea or hot cocoa
                        anytime you want, keep your brewer turned
                        “ON” all the time. However, you can set the
                        brewer to automatically turn off two hours after
                        your last brew. Follow the simple instructions
                        on page 10 to make using the brewer convenient
                        for you</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>

                            <strong>For the best tasting gourmet coffee, tea or
                            hot cocoa, Keurig recommends using bottled
                            or filtered water.</strong> Water quality varies from place to place.
                            If you notice an undesirable taste in your
                            cup of coffee, tea or hot cocoa (such as chlorine
                            or other mineral tastes) we recommend you
                            consider using bottled water or water from a
                            filtration system. For best results, carefully
                            follow manufacturer’s instructions when using
                            any water filtration system</p>

                            perfect for you.</strong> With the choice of over 200varieties of K-Cup®
                            packs and 3 brew sizes (Small Cup-5.25 oz.,
                            Small Mug-7.25 oz. and Large Mug-9.25 oz.),
                            your Keurig® brewer gives you endless options
                            to customize the size, flavor and brew that’s
                            perfect for you. For a strong, intense cup, select
                            an Extra Bold K-Cup® pack (with up to 30%
                            more ground coffee than regular varieties) and
                            brew size that’s right for you. The smaller the
                            brew size, the more intense flavor in your cup.
                            The larger the brew size, the less intense flavor
                            in your cup</p>

                <p>Mineral content in water varies from place to place. Depending on the mineral content of the water in your area, calcium deposits or scale may build up in your brewer. Scale is non-toxic, but left unattended, it can hinder brewer performance. De-scaling your brewer helps maintain the heating element, and other internal parts of the brewer that come in contact with water.</p>
                <img src="KFig15.JPG" alt="Fig. 10" style="margin-right:7%; float:left;">
                <p>The brewer should be de-scaled every 3-6 months to ensure optimal performance. It is possible for calcium deposits to build up faster, making it necessary to de-scale more often.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:10%;">You should promptly de-scale if the red Descale Light is illuminated (fig. 10). However, even if the red Descale Light is not illuminated you should continue to de-scale your brewer every 3-6 months.</p>

                <h3>Service <hr class="subTopic-hr"></h3>
                <p>Beyond these recommended cleaning and maintenance procedures, this brewer is not user serviceable. For service, please refer to the Warranty section of this guide.</p>
                <h3 id="subTopic6">Storage</h3>
                <p>Empty the Water Reservoir before storing and take care to ensure that you store your brewer in a safe and frost free environment. Please be sure to store your brewer in its upright position to avoid water leakage from the inner tank. If you store the brewer in a cold environment, you run the risk of water freezing inside the brewer and causing damage. When you prepare to use it after storage, we recommend rinsing the Water Reservoir with fresh water and running three cleansing brews without a K-Cup® pack.</p>
                <p>If you plan to move your brewer to a different location, turn the brewer off, unplug it and empty the Water Reservoir. If your brewer has been in  an environment below freezing, please be sure to let it warm to room temperature for at least 2 hours before using.</p>
